        "Quantum measurement theory is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, examining how quantum systems are measured and the effects of these measurements on the system. Quantum mechanics typically uses a wave function to describe the state of a system. This wave function fully characterizes the system's state and encompasses all possible outcomes in quantum superposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a quantum measurement is performed, the system's wave function \"collapses\" to a particular outcome. That is, the measurement result takes on a value associated with the property being measured, and other possible outcomes vanish. For example, when measuring a qubit, it collapses to either the \"0\" or \"1\" state, ending the superposition state.\n",

        "In quantum computers, measurement outcomes are often used as part of the computational process. For instance, during the execution of a quantum algorithm, a measurement may be taken at a certain point, and this measurement result can be used to decide whether the algorithm continues or terminates.\n"
