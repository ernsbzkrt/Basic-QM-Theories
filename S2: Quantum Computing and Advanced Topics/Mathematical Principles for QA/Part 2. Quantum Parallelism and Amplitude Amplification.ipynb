        "Quantum parallelism is a fundamental concept that enables quantum computers to operate differently from classical computers. Traditional computers process a specific input at each computation step and obtain the result. For example, a classical computer follows a certain logical path during a computation and performs operations sequentially along this path.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, quantum computers can process multiple computational states simultaneously using concepts such as superposition and entangled states. Superposition means that a quantum bit (qubit) can exist in multiple states simultaneously. For instance, while a classical bit can only have a value of 0 or 1, a qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. By utilizing this feature, quantum computers can progress along many computation paths simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "Entangled states represent relationships between interconnected qubits. These states allow communication and information exchange between qubits during a specific operation. Entangled states enhance computational power by enabling the solution of complex problems. For example, a change made to one qubit can lead to specific changes in other qubits during a computation, allowing multiple computation paths to be followed simultaneously.\n",

For example, during a search process, it can evaluate many different search paths simultaneously and reach the result faster. This feature provides a significant advantage, especially in computations on large datasets compared to classical computers. Quantum parallelism forms the basis of quantum computational power and offers potential solutions to many complex problems."
