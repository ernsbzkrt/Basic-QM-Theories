These transformations are represented by a matrix that reveals the frequency components of the function. The fundamental principle of QFT is to encode different frequency components of a function in different superpositions of qubits, enabling the rapid frequency analysis of functions compared to classical Fourier Transform.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Preparation State**: The process begins with an input state, which can be considered as the encoded version of a specific function on qubits. For instance, the input state can be represented as an array of qubits, and the amplitudes of these qubits reflect the values of the function at different points.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hadamard Transform**: The first step typically involves the Hadamard transform, which creates a superposition state for each qubit (or array of qubits). This prepares the input state as a superposition of different frequency components.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Permutation Transform**: Next, a permutation transform can be applied to change the positions of the qubits. This allows focusing on different frequencies by combining the frequency components of the input state in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Phase Kickback and Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform**: These steps involve a process called phase kickback, which alters the states of qubits to bring out the frequency components of the input state more prominently. Then, an operation called the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform is applied. This operation reverses the QFT and transforms the qubits' states back to the original input state, but with the frequency components more pronounced.\n",

        "5. **Measurement**: Finally, the obtained states are measured. These measurements provide results corresponding to different frequency components of the function.\n",

These superpositions and quantum correlations allow QFT to operate much faster and more effectively than classical Fourier Transform. As a result, QFT can be utilized in various applications on quantum computers and becomes a significant tool, especially in the analysis of large datasets."
