        "Quantum circuits are circuits designed to operate on quantum bits (qubits) and are used in quantum computers. Quantum computers utilize qubits instead of the bits used in classical computers. While classical bits can only take the values of 0 or 1, qubits can take a combination of both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to the quantum superposition property. This feature provides significant advantages of quantum circuits over classical circuits.\n",
