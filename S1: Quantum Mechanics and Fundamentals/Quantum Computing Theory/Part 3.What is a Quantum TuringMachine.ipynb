        "Quantum Turing Machines utilize quantum bits (qubits). While classical computers represent a bit's state as either 0 or 1, quantum computers can hold qubits, particles, in a superposition state where they can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This enables a Quantum Turing Machine to evaluate multiple computation paths simultaneously.\n",
