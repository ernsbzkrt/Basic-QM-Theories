However, unlike other vector spaces, a Hilbert space is equipped with an inner product function, providing a norm structure. Due to these properties, Hilbert spaces possess a rich geometric structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The inner product function is an operation that produces a numerical value for any two vectors in a vector space. This operation generalizes the concept of \"angle\" between vectors. For example, we can use the inner product function to measure how similar or \"opposite\" two vectors are to each other. Additionally, the inner product determines the lengths of vectors and their positions relative to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "The inner product function in Hilbert spaces is typically structured like the dot product of vectors. However, this definition can be extended to infinite-dimensional spaces as well. For instance, operations like integrals can be used to measure the similarity or difference between two functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together with the norm structure provided by the inner product function, a Hilbert space forms a complete vector space. Completeness means that the limit of every Cauchy sequence in this space also belongs to this space. This property makes Hilbert spaces highly useful in mathematical analysis and other fields.\n",
