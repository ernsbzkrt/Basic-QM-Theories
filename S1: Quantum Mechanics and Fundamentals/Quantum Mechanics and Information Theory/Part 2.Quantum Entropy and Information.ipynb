        "Quantum entropy is a concept that measures the uncertainty and information content of quantum states. In quantum mechanics, the entropy of a system expresses the complexity and uncertainty of the system. Von Neumann entropy is the most common form of quantum entropy and is used to measure the purity of a quantum state. If a quantum state is completely pure (meaning the state can be fully described by a specific quantum state), its entropy is zero. However, if the state is mixed (complex), its entropy increases. In the context of information theory, quantum entropy also defines the maximum amount of information that can be obtained from a quantum source."

In this case, Von Neumann entropy is zero because we have complete information about the state of the system, and there is no uncertainty.\n",

        "Mixed states, on the other hand, can be described as a superposition of multiple quantum states, indicating a distribution of probabilities for the system to be in certain states. Such states have higher entropy because it implies we have incomplete or uncertain information about the system. Mixedness is a fundamental feature in quantum mechanics and demonstrates the differences between quantum systems and classical systems."
