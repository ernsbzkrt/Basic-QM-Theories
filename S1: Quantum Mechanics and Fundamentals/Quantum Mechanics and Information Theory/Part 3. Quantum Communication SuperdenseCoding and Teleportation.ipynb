This technique was proposed by Charles Bennett and Stephen Wiesner in 1992. At the core of superdense coding lies the entanglement of two qubits in such a way that an operation performed on one qubit affects the state of the other qubit located remotely. This feature allows for data transmission beyond the capacity of classical communication channels.\n",
