        "Information theory is a mathematical theory based on communication, coding, and information processing.

The more unpredictable a sequence of messages is, the higher its entropy. Mathematically, it's defined as a function of the probabilities of each symbol produced by a source. Shannon entropy is a measure of how efficiently a source of information can be encoded and is often expressed in bits.\n",

This measurement is used to determine the efficiency of data transmission and how \"fast\" a channel is. A channel's capacity is limited by the maximum rate of information that can be transmitted without errors over that channel.\n",

However, when the rate of transmitted information is below the channel capacity, it's possible to reduce the probability of errors to desired levels with appropriate coding methods. This theorem demonstrates the possibility of reliable communication over noisy channels and plays a critical role in the design of digital communication systems.\n",
