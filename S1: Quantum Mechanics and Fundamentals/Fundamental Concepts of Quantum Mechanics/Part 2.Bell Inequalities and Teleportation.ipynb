These inequalities express a set of experimental results that are not compatible with certain assumptions in classical physics but are valid in quantum mechanics. Bell Inequalities specifically demonstrate that the outcomes observed in experiments involving quantum entanglement are not consistent with classical physics, thereby highlighting the nature of quantum mechanics.
