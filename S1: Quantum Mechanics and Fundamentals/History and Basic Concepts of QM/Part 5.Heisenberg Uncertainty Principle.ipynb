        "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and was formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This principle states that certain pairs of properties (such as position and momentum) of a quantum system cannot be measured simultaneously with absolute precision. This is a limitation inherent in the nature of the quantum world, and unlike the Newtonian laws of classical physics, it renders impossible the exact determination of a particle's state. The uncertainty principle plays a critical role in understanding and interpreting quantum mechanics and has been a central topic in the philosophical and technical debates of quantum theory."

        "Quantum computers are types of computers that utilize the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics to operate. While traditional computers operate with fundamental units called bits, which can take values of either 0 or 1, quantum computers work with particles called qubits. Qubits can exist in a state called quantum superposition, meaning they can simultaneously hold both 0 and 1 values. This property can be utilized to solve certain computational problems much faster than classical computers.\n",

Specifically, quantum cryptography is used to detect eavesdropping on transmitted information by exploiting the uncertainty principle. Principles of quantum mechanics demonstrate that measuring the state of a particle alters it and leaves a trace. Therefore, when an eavesdropper attempts to intercept a message, this interference becomes detectable, ensuring security.\n",

Entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles are correlated, and the state of one particle can instantly affect the state of the other.

Because the connection between two particles can be used to detect unauthorized access to information, it ensures the security of communication.\n",

Quantum mechanics acknowledges that particles do not have precise values for properties such as position and momentum at any given moment.
