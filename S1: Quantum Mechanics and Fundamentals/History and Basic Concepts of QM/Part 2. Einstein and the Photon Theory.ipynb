        "In 1905, Albert Einstein introduced the concept of the photon to explain some phenomena that the wave theory of light could not account for in his paper titled \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.\" At that time, it was believed that light propagated only as waves. However, certain experimental results, such as the photoelectric effect, suggested that light also exhibited particle-like properties.\n",

        "Einstein's theory was based on the work of Max Planck on blackbody radiation. Planck proposed that energy was emitted not continuously, but in discrete amounts (quantum). Expanding on this idea, Einstein proposed that light was also emitted in energy quanta and named these energy packets \"photons.\""

        "The Photoelectric Effect refers to the theory developed by Albert Einstein to explain the phenomenon. According to this theory, when light falls on a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface, and the theory investigates the kinetic energy of these electrons. Einstein proposed that the photoelectric effect occurs only when the frequency of light exceeds a certain threshold. In other words, when the frequency of light surpasses a specific minimum value, electrons are released from the metal surface. Additionally, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light. Thus, as the frequency of light increases, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons also increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "This observation demonstrates the particle properties of light and the quantized nature of energy. It indicates that light carries energy in discrete packets called photons, and these energy packets cause the movement of electrons. Therefore, Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect illustrates that light exhibits both wave and particle properties, and the combination of these properties explains the photoelectric effect.\n",

        "E=mc^2: Albert Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 is associated with the photon theory. This equation expresses the equivalence of energy and mass. It establishes a direct relationship between the energy (E) required for a body (m) to accelerate or decelerate and the rest mass of that body. Photons are considered the fundamental particles of light. Despite being massless, the equation demonstrates that photons possess energy and are directly related to their momentum. This equation summarizes a fundamental concept and emphasizes the significance of the mass-energy conversion."
