# Detailed Quantum Theory

This GitHub repository is created to examine, discuss, and share the fundamental theories of quantum mechanics.

## Purpose

This repository aims to discuss the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics for those interested in entering the realm of quantum computing. Quantum computing presents a new computational model that surpasses the capabilities of classical computers. However, understanding and effectively utilizing quantum computing necessitate a grasp of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. This repository intends to serve as a resource for individuals seeking to comprehend the basic concepts of quantum physics. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to translate quantum mechanics knowledge into practical applications and transition into advanced topics such as quantum computing.

In line with this purpose, the repository content will encompass not only quantum mechanics theories but also topics like quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum algorithms. Thus, it will serve as a starting point for building a foundational understanding in the field of quantum computing and advancing further.
